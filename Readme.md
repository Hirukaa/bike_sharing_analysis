# Data Analysis Project: Final Submission

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data to answer specific business questions, visualize the results, and present an interactive dashboard. The analysis follows a structured process: defining questions, conducting analysis, presenting results, and building a simple dashboard with Streamlit.

## Project Requirements
To complete the project, four key criteria must be met:

### Criterion 1: Dataset Selection
This project uses one of the following datasets:

- [Bike Sharing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/bike-sharing-dataset)
- [E-Commerce Public Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)
- [Air Quality Dataset](https://github.com/marceloreis/HTI/tree/master)

### Criterion 2: Data Analysis Process
The project must include the following steps:

1. **Defining Questions**: At least two business questions that guide the analysis.
2. **Data Analysis**: Analysis to answer the business questions.
3. **Visualizations**: At least two data visualizations that address the business questions.
4. **Conclusions**: Summarizing the key insights from the analysis.

### Criterion 3: Organized Notebook
The analysis must be documented in a Jupyter Notebook that follows a clear and organized structure. A provided template should be used to ensure proper documentation and readability.

### Criterion 4: Streamlit Dashboard
A simple Streamlit dashboard must be created to showcase the analysis results in an interactive format. The dashboard should run smoothly on a local environment.
